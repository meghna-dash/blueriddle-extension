Where's your Amazon product really coming from?

Take the guesswork out of online shopping. The Blueriddle Chrome extension tells you if your products are coming from China.

With Blueriddle, you don't have to spend time digging through reviews and seller profiles just to know what you're spending your money on. We dig deeper for information about the seller and manufacturer, so you don't have to. If you'd like to make more informed buying decisions, add this Chrome extension.
